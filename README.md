# nothing-but-netting
Code for a workshop at FinTech devcon 2022!

# setup
1. Ensure that java 17+ is installed. An unexhaustive list of options
	- `brew install openjdk@17` - mac
	- `asdf plugin-add java && asdf install` - mac
	- manual installation from [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-3FDCE921-12B3-4CBB-AE43-2F9E6EBD0B09)
2. Ensure that a java-editor is installed. Any editor will do, but I recommend [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
3. `git clone https://github.com/paxosglobal/nothing-but-netting.git`
4. `cd nothing-but-netting`
5. run the application. You should see action in your terminal followed by a score
	- `./gradlew run` - mac
	- `gradlew.bat run` - windows
6. Open the folder in your java-editor
